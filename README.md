<b>Fourier Faking</b>: this is a notebook that walks through how to create an injected pulsar signal in a power spectrum using brute force dispersion </br> </br>
<b>Kernel Dispersion</b>: this notebook presents a new algorithm for dispersing synthetic data according to a set of DMs. It is more efficient than brute force dispersion by an order of magnitude.
